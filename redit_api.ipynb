Enjoy!\\n\\nINGREDIENTS\\n\\nKebabs\\n* 1 lb vegan ground meat (highly recommend Impossible burger grounds)\\n* 1 medium onion\\n* 2 tsp ginger and garlic paste (alternatively, 1 tsp ginger and 1 tsp garlic)\\n* ¬º cup mint, finely chopped\\n* ¬º cup cilantro, finely chopped\\n* 1 medium jalape√±o pepper (deseeded if you prefer less heat)\\n* 1 tsp ground coriander\\n* ¬æ tsp cumin powder\\n* ¬æ to 1 tsp cayenne pepper (depending on spice preference)\\n* 1 tsp salt\\n* Vegetable oil\\n\\n* To serve: Pita or naan, sliced onion, sliced cucumber and sliced tomato (optional)\\n\\nYogurt Raita\\n* 1 cup plain, unsweetened non-dairy yogurt or sour cream (We used Tofutti sour cream)\\n* 3 tbsp mint\\n* 3 tbsp cilantro\\n* 1 medium jalape√±o pepper (deseeded if you prefer less heat)\\n* 1-2 tbsp water\\n\\nMETHOD\\n1. Grate the onion. Then squeeze as much liquid out of the onions as possible using a dish towel. This step prevents your kebabs from falling apart. \\n2. Blend ginger & garlic (if you don‚Äôt have ginger-garlic paste). The add jalape√±o and blend. \\n3. Into your vegan ground meat, add ground coriander, cumin powder, cayenne pepper, salt, onion, blended ginger/garlic/jalape√±o, mint, and cilantro. Mix well to incorporate. Cover and let marinate in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.\\n4. Meanwhile, make the yogurt raita: Blend jalape√±o, mint, and cilantro with yogurt. Add 1-2 tbsp of water if you prefer a thinner consistency. Season with salt, to taste, and refrigerate. \\n5. Make the kebabs: Fire up your outdoor or stovetop grill. Divide the marinated vegan grounds into four equal balls. Form each ball into a kebab. We flattened our kebabs in order to increase the surface area coming into contact with our grill. The dimensions of each kebab should be about 1.5 inches by 6 inches. Freeze kebabs for 30 minutes to firm up. \\n6. Cook the kebabs: If grilling outdoors, brush the tops of the kebabs with oil before placing on grill. Place the kebabs on the grill oil-side down and brush the other side with oil. Grill kebabs on each side for about 7-10 minutes, ensuring the bottom of the kebab is well seared and firm before flipping.  If pan grilling, heat oil to medium-high heat and cook kebabs until nicely browned on all sides. \\n7. Serve with yogurt raita, pita or naan, and sliced onion/cucumber/tomato. \\n\\n\\nFollow us on Instagram & YouTube!\\n\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/plantbased.passport/\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/3oGhG2aNGm8',\n",

While there's a deeper argument to be made about the overhaul of industrial ag in general, for the time being I think it's more efficient to advocate for better labeling and stricter environmental standards in developing nations rather than swear off palm entirely, because it is possible to produce palm without clearing more rainforest. As a side note, for our health generally speaking, we should all try to move away from the hyperprocessed foods that palm tends to end up in.

So, use cronometer or myfitnesspal or a phone app to track them. \\n\\nThe other key to that is not just eating junk food. You want to also have a healthy diet. You don't necessarily need a healthy diet to gain weight, but it is better for your overall health. Again, make sure you are getting enough of all of your nutrients and emphasize healthy, whole grain carbs and unprocessed foods. You will also wanna eat snacks in between your meals.\\n\\nNow that we covered that, my SO is trying to gain weight so we have some idea of what meals work well. Some of our favorites are:\\n\\n- Smoothies: These are really great because you can pack a lot of calories into them but they aren't overly filling. He snacks on these a lot.\\n- Pasta: we oftentimes add lentils and marinara and some veggies to make our pasta\\n- Rice: same concept, we use rice with a lot of meals or as a great side\\n- Bread: Good for toast, sandwiches, or just dipping in some olive oil and spices\\n- Hummus and chips\\n- Veggie burgers \\n- Muffins: you can make your own but this is also a great snack and can be pretty calorically dense\\n- Vegan yogurt: Good snack or an addition to smoothies\\n- Beans/Lentils/Tofu: protein sources have quite a bit of calories, so add these into your meals\\n- Nut butters\\n\\nThere are so many examples I won't list them all. Try to make your everyday diet easy and just watch your calories to make sure they are over that threshold. As for easy cooking, I use frozen veggies for most things, since they are already chopped. I try to prep things like beans (I cook from dry) beforehand in batches so they are easy to throw together. Additionally, make most of your meals be under 30 minutes and make the snacks under 5-10 minutes. Make eating easy.\",\n",

I mean it when I say these cats followed me and do not stray too far from me becausee of either my company to them or the comfort they have being around. One of my cats, at this point feels so comfortable, she's never inside and ALWAYS outside of my apartment building, just straight up enjoying the outdoors. She loves to join every walk we go on and she walks up to us every time we go outside for any reason, she talks and almost sings to me because he truly wants to show her affection in the only way she knows how. \\nAlthough she is outside by her own choice and I dont surpress her, I still care for her and assure she's being fed and so forth. The other cat loves to go outside still but get this she genuinely WANTS to come inside, she enjoys the comfort of having a comfy place to live and rest. When she's awake and here, she likes to cuddle or be close by, she like to talk, she doesn't go to anyone else but us, and goes on walks with us!! Its very apparent that however she was living her life before I found her on a walk and she didn't leave my side- wasn't as comfortable. Because she willingly comes to my door twice a day usually and meows until I let her in. She loves to cuddle with me, purring loudly and just staying there for long periods of time. She loves it at my house despite having a dog or anything! \\n\\nNow my dog, literally if he hadn't been rescued, would be living in a cage all day. Now her at least gets to live and run around, play, relax, cuddle. All things he does and enjoys because he will willingly go and lay in his little bed, he'll come and cuddle up between my legs he'll literally smile most days after going on a walk, and when I come home he gets so excited, he lays down and exposes his belly and begs to be pet.... \\n\\nI see your point, but the thing is, in my experience, these animals appreciate the life they get to live for having us as parents basically.. maybe not every case is the same.
